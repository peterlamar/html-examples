# Webpack intro

Primary benefits of using webpack to compile and merge together javascript code. Quoted
from the webpack intro site.

1. It is not immediately apparent that the script depends on an external library.
2. If a dependency is missing, or included in the wrong order, the application will not function properly.
3. If a dependency is included but not used, the browser will be forced to download unnecessary code.
4. Enable old browsers to access code
